/* Simple Distance Sensor Program */

/* Basic principle of the HC-SR04 sensor is:
 *  From datasheet, basic working is:
 *  (A) Using IO trigger for at least 10us high level signal,
 *  (B) The Module automatically sends eight 40 kHz and detect whether there is a pulse signal back.
 *  (C) IF the signal back, through high level , time of high output IO duration is the time from sending ultrasonic to returning.
 *  (D)Test distance = (high level time√óvelocity of sound (340M/S) / 2,  Formula: uS / 58 = centimeters or uS / 148 =inch; 
 *  
 *  So, what we do is the following:
 *  1. We send a pulse of around 12 ms to the trigger pin of the sensor to start the transmission of the signal. 
 *  2. When the pulse is reflected back, we need to find hte time period of the reflected pulse. We do so, by setting an interrupt whenever there is a logic change. When there is a logic change from low to high, we start a timer and when there is a logic change from high to low, we stop the timer. This value is then stored.
 *  3. Using this value, we can calculate the distance of the object using the formula given.
